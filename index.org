#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple
ideas, are chiefly these three:
- 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made.
- 2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations.
- 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.

—John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)
